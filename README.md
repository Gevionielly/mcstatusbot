# mcstatusbot

## Overview

Track online and the number of players on your Minecraft server through a Discord bot!

index.js keeps track of when the server is actually offline, when index_aternos.js keeps track of when the server's MOTD has the words "this server is offline.".

**Don't forget to configure the bot in config.json!**
