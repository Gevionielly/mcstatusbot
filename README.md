# mcstatusbot

## Overview

Track online and the number of players on your Minecraft server through a Discord bot!

Regular index.js keeps track of when the server is actually off, while index_aternos.js keeps track of when the server's MOTD has the word "offline".

Don't forget to put your bot token in config.json and your server address in index.js.
